Observations : 
	
	- Panel switch is shorted, we had to unplug and plug it again to turn it on.
	- Computer turns on fine for few seconds (5-6 seconds) and then turns off, this made us suggest a bad current is going through the circuit.
	- All fans work except the fan in the power supply (another hint that the power supply have problems).
	- RAM is cleaned and the CMOS battery works.
	- The system is not properly cleaned. Cobwebs and dusts are present, especially in the power supply.
	- There is one "bloated" capacitor in the power supply.

Problems :

	- Computer can't power on completely, it turns off after few seconds of booting.
	- Not enough boot time to hear beeps from built in speaker.

Solution :

	- Firstly, there must be a problem on the power supply. Check if the cables are properly plugged.
	- Try replacing the power supply. If there are still problems, then the problem must be in the motherboard.
	- Clean the unit. There must be dust particles or other problems causing a fluctuation in the current.
